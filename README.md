# SearchTabs
Simple Tab Search Extension for Chrome. 

I created this because I was inspired by a Youtube short late in the night. Really fun and works pretty well. 
To use, clone this repository and maybe put it in a different folder, then, go to chrome://extensions/ and switch on "Developer Mode" from the top right toggle.
Once developer mode is on, find the "Load Unpacked" option on the top left and load up the folder. 

Enjoy, and feel free to suggest any changes!
